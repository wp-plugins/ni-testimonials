Very simple Testimonials Plugin Created By Network Intellect

Please note that I have created this plugin as a personal project to use across various sites that I make, therefore there will be no custom support or feature requests in regards this plugin.

You are of course more than welcome to use it however if you wish and it fulfils your needs.

It currently supports the following shortcode with options:

[ni-testimonials] - Shows all testimonials with all types

[ni-testimonials type=""] - Enables you to specify which type of testimonial to show - e.g home-page

[ni-testimonials includes=""] - Comma seperated list of testimonial IDs to include - e.g 1,3,5,4
